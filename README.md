# bachelor-thesis
This is the main part of the codebase of my bachelor thesis.

The two main files are pybullet_push.py which contains the push problem implementation and pybullet_lifting_object.py which contains the grasp problem implementation.

If you are not using pyCharms console output to log file functionality, you need to comment out the last line in both of the files or else it will lead to an error.
